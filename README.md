# Modular Robotics Simulation

This repository is a fork of the modular-robotics repo, hosted by the University of Massachusetts Lowell's Modular Robotics Group.

This copy is a portfolio-friendly version showcasing the graphics work I personally contributed to the team's modular robotics research toolkit. It is not kept up-to-date with the latest revisions of the tools.

Two tools are preserved in this repo: a desktop-based C++/OpenGL program for modular robotics ("Vistool"), and its browser-based Javascript/WebGL successor ("WebVis"). Documentation can be found in this repo's wiki.
